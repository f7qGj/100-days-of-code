**Today's Progress**: Been working on a memory match card game. 

**Thoughts:** While I completed the main components towards the end of September, I did not get the files onto a live server until 10/01/2022. I was struggling with the command rsync, moving files from my local server to my remote server on DigitalOcean.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

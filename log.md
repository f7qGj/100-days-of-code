# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 1: October 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Been working on a memory match card game. Issued the domain an SSL certificate with LetsEncrypt. 

**Thoughts:** While I completed the main components of the game towards the end of September, I did not get the files onto a live server until 10/01/2022. I was struggling with the command rsync, moving files from my local server to the remote server on DigitalOcean.

### Day 2: October 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a new github account. Fought with git to remove old github account and connect new github account with proper keys. Forked the "100 Days of Code" repo to my local and pushed it to remote github server. 

**Thoughts:** I was able to create a new github repository, but I would like to know how to point a live server to a github repository. So I can push changes made from my local to github, then pull changes from github to the live server. Brain is feeling a little toast though. I will probably work on something a little easier and try tackling live server stuff tomorrow. 

### Day 3: October 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Research Twitter API - generate/share tweets from a website. The goal is to create a fortune cookie and give the user the option to post their fortune to their twitter account.

### Day 4: October 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Building AIM chat with CSS

**Thoughts**: Just for fun, might add actual chat capability later in the future. 

**Resources**: None

### Day 5: October 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Building a leaderboard with NodeJS. Successfully can use requests POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET. Need to learn how to make the API call so I can add data to leader board on website.
